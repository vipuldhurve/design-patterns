## Prototype : Creational Design Pattern
- Creating new objects(instances) by cloning(copying) other objects.
- Allows for adding of any subclass instance of a known superclass at runtime.
- When there are numerous potential classes that you want to only use if needed at runtime.
- Reduces the need for creating subclasses.
